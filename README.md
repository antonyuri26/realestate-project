The use of CSS grid system made it possible to create a fluid design that adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring that users can easily navigate the website no matter what device they are using. This project was a great opportunity for me to demonstrate my skills using only HTML and advanced CSS techniques to create a modern and user-friendly real estate website.
